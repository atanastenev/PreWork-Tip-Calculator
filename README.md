Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Contains options to include other people and split the total bill, add on a Settings Navigator, and a elementary Dark Mode feature (unfinished)

## Notes

I had a lot of trouble with finding out how to use the extra fearures. I only had one day to complete the app and wish I had more time to experiment with all the features XCode and Swift have to offer. For instance, I wanted to add a dark more feature but could not figure out how to access elements from one view controller to another. I searched several places and saw many different approaches but not all of them worked. I truly am passionate about learning more and I hope you accept me into the course because I would love to learn more. I did go to office hours with Guillermo and he hellped me a lot with some things, but we didn't have time to address all of the questions I had. I did learn and watch videos on Auto Layouts, but did not have the time to apply my knowledge on this app - I used my knowledge on the PreWork for the Mobile Product Manager Application because I have not yet decided which one to take. I am very interested in learning more about app development.
